Story by Joni

ACT 1:
You wake up. You notice that you are sleeping in the strong hands of a stuffed 
polar bear. On the floor. What ever happened last night at the party you were in
no-one knows. 

Oh, and you are a skeleton. WTF MAN!?

The only thing you can find from the lobby is a note that says: FIND THE GOLDEN PIE!

Now, my dear Skeleton, start walking...

ACT 2:
You get out of Klusteri. You are now faced with serious challenges. You must 
find your bodyparts that are scattered all over the place. Only when you've found
all of them you might find the mysterious GOLDEN PIE...

ACT 3:
