Story by Joni

ACT 1:
You wake up. You notice that you are sleeping in the strong hands of a stuffed 
polar bear. On the floor. What ever happened last night at the party you were in
no-one knows. 

Oh, and you are a skeleton. WTF MAN!?

The only thing you can find from the lobby is a note that says: FIND THE GOLDEN PIE!

Now, my dear Skeleton, start walking...

!Press ENTER to continue!

ACT 2:
You get out of Klusteri. You are now faced with serious challenges. You must 
find your bodyparts that are scattered all over the place. You can't stop walking.
Only when you've found all of the parts you might find the mysterious GOLDEN PIE...

!Press ENTER to continue walking...!

ACT 3: 
Found your first bodypart did you? Nicely done!

Now, the next step would be to.. well find all the rest. Pronto!
Living with that ugly face.. ..skull.. of yours won't get you alot of pie will it?!

Get walking!

ACT 4:
You've found most of the parts you lost last night but one is still to be found.
Where is it? No, really! Where the hell is it?

KEEP LOOKING DUMBO!

ACT 5:
There it is! The great Golden Pie! And it's.. it's umm... yea. Well, have 
a look at it yourself..
